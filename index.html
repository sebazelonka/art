      <p>
        This is a project where you can buy pixels for $1 each. You can buy as
        many pixels as you want, and you can draw whatever you want. The only
        rule is that you can't buy more than 10 pixels at a time. Each "pixel"
        is 10x10 pixels in size and you can customize the color of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal for this project is to create an image from all the different
        pixels working togheter in a 1280 x 720px canvas.
